Project Summary : HandGesture-MNIST

Idea Behind Making This Project

The HandGesture-MNIST project was conceived to develop a robust hand gesture recognition system using machine learning techniques. Inspired by the MNIST dataset, which is widely used for handwritten digit recognition, this project extends the concept to recognize hand gestures. The primary motivation was to create an intuitive and interactive system capable of interpreting human gestures for applications such as sign language recognition, human-computer interaction, and accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities.

About the Project

The HandGesture-MNIST project involves the creation and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures. The project encompasses several key stages:

1. Dataset Preparation: Creation or acquisition of a dataset containing images of hand gestures, which are labeled for training and evaluation purposes.
2. Preprocessing: Normalization, resizing, and augmentation of images to improve model performance and generalization.
3. Model Design: Implementation of a CNN architecture to learn features from hand gesture images.
4. Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the prepared dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
5. Deployment: Developing a user interface to allow real-time hand gesture recognition.

Software Used in the Project

- Python: Primary programming language for implementing the project.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
